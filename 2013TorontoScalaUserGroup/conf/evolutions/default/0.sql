# Always prefer 'bin' as the default database collation instead of 'general_ci' or 'unicode_ci'.
#
# Since collations are used in comparisons, the following statement would, for instance, update
# all rows with name "Antonio" to "Ant么nio":
#
#    update user set name = "Ant么nio" where name = "Ant么nio"
#
# Collations are also used to determine uniqueness. If 'name' is a unique key, the table can't
# have two rows with names "Antonio" and "Ant么nio".
#
# The default collation can always be overridden as needed on a query basis:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/charset-collate.html

# --- !Ups

create database sample
  charset utf8mb4
  collate utf8mb4_bin;

# --- !Downs

drop database sample;
